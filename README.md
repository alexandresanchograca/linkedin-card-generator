# linkedin-card-generator

Backend:
A REST API that scrapes a LinkedIn profile and returns a response with the data collected. and builds a business card using React.
<br>
You need to have a running instance of a chromedriver to run the scraper.

Download Chromedriver on the official website:
https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/#stable

Make sure your chromedriver is compatible with the current version of your chrome browser.

Frontend:
A React website that sends requests to the API and builds a business card with the returned data. This card can be easily printed.
This was my first time doing anything in React so take this code with a huge grain of salt.
